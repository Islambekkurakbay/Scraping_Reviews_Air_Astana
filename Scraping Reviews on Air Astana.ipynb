Our flight was delayed for over an hour in Astana - an additional one hour later than my original booking. This meant that I now have too short a transit time and need to be re-scheduled. I received an SMS advising that I am rescheduled for a morning flight (arrival 10 a.m. the next day instead of 6 pm) I then went into frantic messages to my hotel in Astana cancelling my booking - about AUD100 extra for a few hours! On check-in I was moved to another later flight with no discussion with me. So I am unaware of this, land in Almaty transit and go to the counter to check my hotel voucher. There, I am directed to the amended boarding pass and it is for a night flight arriving 10pm. So, again, frantic messages to my hotel - after over 20 minutes running around to get a Kazakh SIM card - to re-book my room. I found the place now fully booked. Called them and thankfully, they re-booked my room. ',\n",

The food was excellent, it was breakfast but hot, tasty and filling. The amenities packs are now eco friendly. They contain all those items that one requires on a journey of 3 hours or longer. They look good too. It was a new aircraft that was very clean, with comfy seats and was equipped with an excellent entertainment package. My only concern was travelling during these difficult times and the flight was full, understandably with the reduce number of flights scheduled. The in cabin safety brief, which is excellent and worth watching in all three languages, has had an amendment to relate to the latest pandemic requirements.
