Our flight was delayed for over an hour in Astana - an additional one hour later than my original booking. This meant that I now have too short a transit time and need to be re-scheduled. I received an SMS advising that I am rescheduled for a morning flight (arrival 10 a.m. the next day instead of 6 pm) I then went into frantic messages to my hotel in Astana cancelling my booking - about AUD100 extra for a few hours! On check-in I was moved to another later flight with no discussion with me. So I am unaware of this, land in Almaty transit and go to the counter to check my hotel voucher. There, I am directed to the amended boarding pass and it is for a night flight arriving 10pm.

Check in at LHR was efficient and fast track through security excellent. However the flight was then delayed at the last minute and there was hardly any seating at the gate where we had to wait, no announcements/updates and few staff who seemed a little disorganised and unhelpful. Several passengers including myself had connecting flights which was making people quite agitated as they were unsure what would happen if they missed their connections. Once aboard, the cabin layout and space were excellent. Staff were efficient, polite and you were made to feel very welcome. The food choices were great, very tasty and portion sizes just right. There was a huge choice of drink options too. The seat converted easily to a very low level lay flat bed and I managed to sleep for a few hours. Upon arrival in Nur Sultan I was met off the flight (pre-arranged) and taken through security with a quick stop in the lounge to freshen up before joining my connecting flight on to Almaty. The lady who met me was excellent and couldn’t have been more helpful. It was a huge help to me as I was travelling alone and there was very limited time to pass from international to domestic and then find my onward flight to Almaty. She spoke perfect English and made the transfer very smooth for me. The flight to ALA was good. Plenty of leg room and great adjustments on the seat, especially for leg support, but perhaps more tricky to climb out of from a window seat than the previous flight layout. The breakfast menu was excellent as you could choose anything from a pastry and coffee right up to a full cooked breakfast. The cabin crew served this efficiently in a limited time frame. My return journey was equally enjoyable. On the Nur Sultan to LHR leg there were about 40% seats not occupied in business class which made the experience even more special as the staff had more time to ensure you were comfortable. It was nice to be able to enjoy this leg during daylight hours as I’d slept a chunk of the outward version of this leg! All in all I really enjoyed my first experience with Air Astana.

Also my friend’s luggage was lost on his flight. Asked me to help him to negotiate with lost and found team since he doesn’t speak Russian. The operator was non-helping. When i asked her the approximate time his luggage will be delivered she told me that it will be there after one hour. We waited 3 hours at hotel lobby at night, and didn’t get it.

I’m on the verge of tears midway through a journey from Tashkent to London via Almaty and Astana. My flight from Astana to London has been delayed, which happens. It’s not the first time and won’t be the last. Air Astana’s handling of the delay has bee utterly abysmal and frankly negligent. I was at the airport 1.5 hours before my flight was due to leave as I was transferring from Almaty. I had no notification or text message, I just found out when I wanted to make my way to the gate! I tried to find some staff, no one was around to ask questions. I went to the business lounge, who rang someone and said “they’re coming”. A whole 40 mins later, no one came. I went to one of the gates to ask staff there. They asked if I was on the Dubai flight. When I said no, they walked off. At this point I didn’t know whether my flight was cancelled, delayed or what time it was due to London. I eventually found a desk in the corner of the terminal and they advised me to go upstairs to get some food and water. They had no vegetarian options at all and tiny cups of water.

On their website, the baggage policy for Economy class is stated as 20 kilos, with no mention of a 1 kilo policy. We flew from Moscow to Shymkent and even though our confirmation page clearly stated we are economy passengers with 1 piece of luggage included, we were forced to pay for excess luggage because their system showed we are not allowed checked luggage.

When I complained to cabin crew, they were arrogant and told me you did not pay to block so we can move you if we want. They were not at all apologetic for the delay, on top of that they did not serve a proper meal saying that I had not made a special request, which is strange as I had not made a special request while coming into to Almaty as well, but the they served the meal.

The Air Astana ground staff in Baku Airport made absolutely no formal announcement in English about the process. So we did not know what to do and what to expect. Many passengers just formed a circle around the ground staff and it was a total chaos. The whole process took almost 5 hours from flight cancellation until we got our bags and left the airport. All passengers were very exhausted and we were not provided any food or drink during that time. We were provided food or drink for the first time around 6 hours after flight cancellation. It seems to me that Air Astana could not professionally handle flight delay/cancellation situations.

New aircraft, updated stylish kits for passengers and especially children, comfortable chairs. I felt myself, like I was in business class!

They suggested I contact their office who has not responded to my questions. Staff even asked me to please complain because this happens so often and they are clearly sick of it. To avoid this problem for others, I would recommend not using this airline as they were extremely unprofessional and no one could answer my questions.

I've heard nothing but good things about Air Astana, but my experience even exceeded those high expectations. On the 2hr45m trip from Baku to Almaty, there was a full amenity kit provided (that which rivals those on transatlantic routes) ear plugs, pen, toothbrush and toothpaste, lotion, comb, eye mask, and socks! Small candies were provided before takeoff on both flights. The meal provided from Baku to Almaty was average (it's always a risk coming from a city which isn't a hub.) On the Almaty-Bishkek leg, water was provided before takeoff, as it's a less than 1 hour-long flight. The cabin crew were so pleasant and well spoken in Kazakh, Russian, and English, and the pilots gave beautifully detailed and eloquent messages in all three languages as well. Seats were average, but I didn't mind with all of the other services provided. Important - Row 14 on the 757-200 aircraft has no window, so please take caution when reserving seats.

Actually there were at least 3 flights, which were delayed around of this time. Ground staff of Air Astana did excellent work. Even though it was crowded, they handle situation professionally. 5 star to Ground staff. (Except of one thing. Lady on the check-in counter told me, that there is no delay of the flight, when actually it was a delay for 30 mins. I mean, not a big deal and most probably delay wasn't announced to staff at that moment. But fact is fact, I would rather spend 30 mins with my beloved ones, instead of crowded ""transit"" area (if you can call Almaty airport hall a transit area)). Real bad experience starting with announcement of the flight. Not sure, whose fault it is, airport or airline, but should be sorted. You can not hear, what staff announced, it is simply hard to understand about which flight she was talking about. Sound had a really bad quality. Waiting area was crowded and too loud. Almaty airport is very old and small. It should be replaced a long time ago. The reason, why I'm leaving this comment are cabin crew. Seriously guys, you need to review your politics and training program. As a constant customer, you can see how quality is going down. If Supervisors and business class crew are still on track, your junior/economy staff is losing a mark. Crew was rude. They commanded to do procedures, before take off and when customers (who may never flew before) looked for explanation, the answers were very sharp and again rude.  Crew responded with single words, time to time mixing it with Russian, and it was obvious that it was hard for them to express themselves in single sentence.  They gave an option of two meals, as usual chicken and beef. However during serving, crew literally served us without asking anything. When someone noticed, that they would prefer beef, crew responded, that she would prefer beef as well, but what is left is left. Same crew complained, that she has to wait for customers when all of them visit restroom, and because of what she is not able to serve the rest, who were keep calling her.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Almaty to Istanbul,June 2019,4,1,3,4,5.0,,2,yes,

However, I also paid for the ticket. I was’t taking free flight. We were waiting until she provided blanket to all women and children. However, she has never come back with blanket to us.

Boarding was chaotic, as they annouced boarding, traveling business class I rushed to the gate, only to be told to wait 10 minutes. Then, they started boarding the around 100 economy class passengers as I waited standing by the counter. After around 15 minutes, I was invited to board, very weird process. Once onboard, I was greeted by 2 friendly flight attendants, who showed my seat and offered an welcome drink. Cabin was beautiful with mood lighting and well apointed, very comfortable seat for 2 hours flight. After take off, they offered more drinks with warm nuts, plus took dinner orders. Food was delicious, well prepared and of high quality. Next flight from Astana to Almaty, they offered a good lounge in Astana, with some basic snacks. They had a special boarding line for business, boarding was very efficient and fast. 767 cabin is really beautiful, well appointed and comfortable even for longer flights. Welcome champagne offered and menus distributed. Food, once again, excellent and high quality, as well as drinks options. From Almaty to Hong Kong, the longest portion, I was invited to the lounge, but as I entered it, I was advised that Air Astana passengers cannot use the buffet facility or bar, and must pay for any drink consumption of drinks, even water. Noticed passengers from other airlines using the same lounge to have access to a full buffet and drinks choice, so very poor experience for Air Astana premium customers. Anyway, they also offered a separate line for business class and boarding was fast and efficient. Once again a 767 with beautiful cabin and very comfortable flat seats. Also this time, crew was courteous and friendly and dinner was of high quality, as well as drinks.

Based on the report from our colleagues in Beijing, on arrival you were met by our staff, who checked your baggage tag and passport. After the transfer counter opened, you were provided with boarding pass on time and continued with your flight to Hong Kong.

89,Air Astana customer review,Ivan Nikitin (Russian Federation) ,8th August 2018,Trip Verified,"✅   Moscow to Delhi via Almaty. Moscow to Almaty on a new Boeing 767, with personal entertainment screens and mood lighting. Staff accommodating and professional. The meal was delicious with metal cutlery. Wine and beer were complimentary (no spirits on the menu, though), and extras were served with no frowns. IFE was one of the best I experienced, no lag whatsoever. One weird thing was that the screen by design could not be adjusted when the seat in front was reclined, so the viewing angles could be uncomfortable. We were given outstanding amenity kits with neck air pillow, slippers, pen, some hand cream, eye shades and ear plugs. Different coloured kits seemed to have slightly different content, so make sure to collect them all. The crew passed the cabin with drinks several times after the meal service. Seat comfort was okay, nothing outstanding. Almaty to Delhi was on an older A321, with no personal screens. The seats were very comfortable with great seat pitch and traditional ""thick"" profile of the seats. Cabin crew were lovely and the meal was even better. There were some amenity kits given as well, except a bit smaller ones (which makes sense on a 3 hour daytime flight). You could access their entertainment via your own device and onboard wi-fi for free with no issues, and the selection was impressive, but the lack of power ports meant you will run out of power quite soon. Delhi to Almaty was practically the same as the flight from Almaty to Delhi. For Almaty - Moscow I have made a bet to upgrade on their website (the lowest amount possible), and we were upgraded to business. The flight on a Boeing 767 was wonderful with lie-flat seats, lots of privacy and space, great IFE and pleasant cabin. The cabin crew were very accommodating, greeting us with champagne as a pre-departure drink, and the purser greeted us by name, making sure we had a fantastic flight. Meals were delicious, each course was brought separately. If I could think of any improvement in business class, it would be alcohol menu, because there were just one type of champagne, one type of white and red wine (plus lots of spirits and cocktails). I believe the wine card can and should be improved. Their Bloody Mary was perfect, by the way. Almaty airport is an absolute disaster - it's small, crowded, with nowhere to sit or relax, no decent cafes, everyone is shouting at everyone. Even in business class lounge there is nothing to eat or drink for free, which is just a disgrace. Our luggage made it, and the flights were on time, though. To conclude, I recommend Air Astana, and the economy experience is outstanding, but I will try to fly via Astana next time, since Almaty airport is just so awful.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Delhi via Almaty,June 2018,5,5,5,5,3.0,5.0,5,yes,Boeing 767 / A321

92,"""significant improvements""",Alan Sargeant (Australia) ,22nd July 2018,Trip Verified,"✅   St Petersburg to Bangkok via Almaty. There has been significant improvements to this airline in the fourteen years since I first flew. It was a day service between St Petersburg and Almaty on a clean A320. Seats were comfortable, spacious and with a reasonable recline. Food was good and well presented. In flight entertainment was on tablets and there was a reasonable selection. Cabin service was a little hit and miss - I asked for wine with my meal and by the time I realised that it had been forgotten I had finished and did not ask for it. The cabin crew spoke reasonable/good English but only spoke to me in Russian because initially I had spoken to them in Russian. The check in in St Petersburg was fast, efficient and in English. They had a bus for business class passengers to go to the plane. The flight departed and arrived on time and my luggage was among the first offloaded in Almaty. The Almaty - Bangkok sector was a night flight on a new Dreamliner 769 with a dinner type meal at about 2.30 am. Check in in Almaty was slow because the operator was dealing with problems for a couple of economy class passengers. (It would have been faster to use the economy check in counter)! Food was good and the seat/bed was comfortable and there was quite a selection of in flight entertainment. I was identified as a foreigner and so spoken to in good English.

99,"""Not the worst but not the best""",D Jackson (Kazakhstan) ,25th June 2018,Trip Verified,"✅  Air Astana has practically a monopoly in the Central Asian region where I live and work and they don’t hesitate to remind the customer of that. I have travelled approximately 75-100 legs on this airline for business and have purchased several tickets to and from Moscow for both myself and my fiance. You’d think this sort of ‘loyalty’ (is it really loyalty when you consider the lack of available options?) would earn me a little more respect than what I received today, but judging from my experience with the gate agents contracted by the airline at various airports, all I seem to get is ignorance and hostility. Customer service is arguably not very highly esteemed in Central Asia in my experience so I’m long past expecting “service with a smile.” I was caught unawares today by a excess baggage fee when flying out of Dushabe. Apparently Air Astana has recently started offering bare bones fares whose limitations are in no way reflected in the pricing. These fares offer a downright insulting 1 kg baggage limit (10kg for Nomad Club Silver members) when the standard tickets allow for 20kg (30kg) respectively. I unknowingly booked this fare through a third-party website where there was no indication that this wasn’t a standard fare ticket. As I said, the ticket price wasn’t particularly cheap. I expect this sort of thing from FlyDubai or Wizz Air but from a national flagship airline? Seriously? Of course what incentive do you have to treat repeat customers well when you practically have a government-backed monopoly? And about the Nomad Club, it’s quite possibly the stingiest airline rewards program there is. Almaty Airport, the airline’s hub, is a glorified bus station which is insanely overcrowded, overpriced, and boring. On a positive note, the air crew staff are polite, if not exceedingly.

Air Astana has set and manages to maintain exceptional high standards of service. Al the cabin crew appear to have fundamental English skills. The new uniform is fresh and professional. The safety video has been improved and is actually pleasant to watch even after many flights in a short time frame. The new aircraft have screens on the backs of the seats and passengers can select their entertainment. The new earphones are great and I always keep the set. The passenger pack is in a useful bag and the products inside are good but I miss the mini-biro pen. The food and beverages are of good quality with a proper cutlery. I have found the cabin crew to be attentive and responsive to my needs. Depending on the airport I have boarded check-in staff may not have the same consistency but my recent check in at Atyrau was good (this is not usually a friendly airport though there are some exceptional individuals working there).

This flight was departing almost 7 hours later, at 5:50 am. However, when I approached the counter I found out the flight was already delayed to 19:00 pm. 13 hours delay! Ridiculous. And they let me buy the ticket from their own webpage. Most of the passengers accepted hotel and waiting, but ten of us couldn't wait. I explained to them about my connecting flight to Valencia and I accepted any possible route which would take me to Frankfurt on time or any part of Spain but they denied this option for four hours, insisting on my delayed flight with them as my only option (13h waiting in Bangkok airport plus 14h in Astana). Missing my connection to Valencia and being late for work. I even got the chance to talk to someone from management on the phone, but she would only say ""I'm sorry"". Only good part was their ground staff, which suffered this situation exemplary even though they were lacking the power to do something. Finally I accepted the refund of my ticket, which they signed, and booked a flight with another airline, spending a big amount of money to get to Madrid. After this, I was expecting the refund of the ticket, but they only offer me 3.930THB, which is not even a 1/4 of the amount I paid for the ticket.

When in the beginning of January they started offering promotion flights to several destination in March for their loyalty card holders, me and my sister decided to take advantage of it and planned our trip to Paris during Nauryz (3 day National holiday in Kazakhstan) in advance. However, on Monday they notified us that the flight has been changed from 21.03 to 23.03 due to ""Spring flight schedule corrections"", thus completely eliminating any chance of using these Holidays for a trip. These types of corrections are definitely planned way in advance and should have been addressed BEFORE offering promotions on the dates.

The flight was advertised having IFE, but this aircraft didn't have any, which was quite a pity. The flight from Astana to Urumqi was with a relatively new A320. The seats on both aircraft were a little old and wobbly. Crew is very friendly and hands out candies prior to take-off and landing. Dinner on the flight from Frankfurt to Astana was good, they even have a menu card. If you order a beer you get a 500cl can, which was a pleasant surprise. All passengers get a small kit with tooth brush, sleeping mask, ear plugs and a pen (useful to fill in immigration cards). During my trip from Amsterdam to Urumqi, I did not encounter any Air Astana ground staff. But when travelling back to Amsterdam, I did and I can say that ground staff is very friendly and helpful, speak English very well. On the way back our flight from Urumqi to Astana was delayed for 4 hours. It was a very pleasant surprise that Air Astana ground staff handed out burgers and softdrinks while we were waiting.

The flight attendant was very kind, making sure everything was fine. On the way back was in business class, very good experience once again, nice meal and atmosphere, with good features and amusement.

KC is now genuinely a world class airline.

On the flight to Almaty lunch was served and on the flight to Bangkok a very late dinner was served. With a 1.00 am departure for Bangkok the Airline would be much better served by giving a light supper soon after take off (or have a decent meal available in their lounge) and then having breakfast about one hour before landing. The food was well presented and portion size was adequate. The wines were OK. On the Tbilisi - Almaty sector they offered an IPAD but did not take advantage as I had my own entertainment.

Air Astana responded to every email of mine within minutes and while we were to have an overnight layover in Astana in the original plan with a hotel paid by us, Air Astana put us up in a new Bishkek hotel with food and transport to and from the airport. The flights themselves were on time, had more then average legroom, newer planes, good food and friendly attendants.

Even if the 757 was fully refurbished and the cabin were really well made, they can't hide the age of the plane.

The food and beverages are very acceptable and there is a excellent selection of meals for those with special dietary requirements. Something I need to use myself. I enjoy the music selection though the earphones are poor and so I carry my own. You can't always be lucky with the movie but it is guaranteed to be recent.

I resent the imposition on my time. The seats were slanted and I slid off the seat while trying to sleep on it. I may have gotten two hours of sleep on a seven hour flight. Making up for all these issues was the amazingly attentive and thorough staff and the delicious food. They opened the wrong red wine and when I pointed out that it didn't correspond with the menu they had given us, they found the correct bottle and opened it.

There was a kind refund policy, in which you pay 40 USD per flight as a refund fee if you want to cancel, and you can cancel anytime. I also read that you can get a refund or exchange the ticket if you miss the flight! On the flight the staff weren't petty  and didn't complain when I changed seats and laid across them for a full five hours sleep. Unfortunately the connection flight couldn't leave because the weather outside was so windy and snowy, so i spent a night in Astana, Kazakhstan, in a free and clean hotel with a bus stop right outside of it that very regularly goes directly to the airport for just £0.20. I then caught a flight to Paris the next day on a very modern plane, and from there on Air France to London, which was arranged without cost by Air Astana. Staff generally spoke very good english in Astana, and the office is within the small airport - so there's always someone available for help. When the flight was cancelled due to bad weather in Astana, there was very little information going around as to what would happen next. A simple series of messages would really have put me at ease, as I was quite stressed at the time. But things did turn out completely fine, to my reassuring surprise. The other problem was when I caught the flight from Paris to London, my baggage had not been put on the same flight! To be fair, this may not have been Air Astana fault, as the baggage label definitely listed both Paris and London airports. The bag was put on an Air France flight the next morning and delivered to where I live in about 2 days. I also had a tracking code that I could use to check where the bag was at any time.

200,Air Astana customer review,Ledger James (Australia) ,3rd April 2015,,I recently flew return from BKK to ALA. It was the first time I've flown Air Astana and I have to say that I was delighted with the attentive anticipatory levels of service I received. The plane itself looked brand new the business class cabin was spotless and a true delight to sit in. While the inflight entertainment was not as extensive as higher profile airlines this wasn't an issue for me. The dining experience was excellent quality varied food presented fantastically. The service and the environment along with the punctuality made this an excellent first experience of an airline that is clearly having an effect in the region.,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,4,,,5,yes,
201,Air Astana customer review,Gail Mowat (United Kingdom) ,3rd April 2015,,12/2/15 KS942/952 London - Almaty. 21/2/15 KS601/941 Almaty - London. You really get the feeling with Air Astana that the company is genuinely striving for improvement all the time. Staff are extremely courteous and helpful planes are really clean flights generally arrive on time. The new economy sleeper is a winning option for people who dread the loss of a nights sleep but cannot bring themselves to fork out the full business class fare. I travelled with my four children and we all thought economy sleeper was brilliant. At least a chance of sleep much more space quieter cabin and better food that in economy.,,Economy Class,,,4,4,3,3,,,4,yes,
202,Air Astana customer review,Hadaway Darryl (Kazakhstan) ,3rd April 2015,,Flight KC929 20 February. Was an overnight flight. Flight left on time and cabin crew were extremely thoughtful. Placed blanket over me while sleeping and when woke even though food service had finished and on way to landing - they found an apple to give me. Was a great experience and very impressed by cabin crew attitude.,,Economy Class,,,4,5,N/A,N/A,,,4,yes,
203,Air Astana customer review,Hadaway Darryl (Kazakhstan) ,3rd April 2015,,Flight KC930 24 February. Return trip from Hong Kong in mid February. Plane was very delayed but informed. Could in my view been done earlier but was nice to be told a couple of hours in advance. Trip itself was pleasant. Good inflight entertainment and again the inflight crew did an excellent job and were responsive to needs. Food could be improved as compared to other airlines traveled but do note it is economy class.,,Economy Class,,,5,5,3,5,,,4,yes,
204,Air Astana customer review,J Davidson (Hong Kong) ,21st January 2015,,I found this routing from HK-Almaty very convenient and have done it a couple of times now.

205,Air Astana customer review,S Rise (Israel) ,21st January 2015,,ALA-TSE. B757-200 not new AC but fully refurbished to perfection. Clean and inviting. Crew very well groomed wonderful IFE tasty hot snack on this 80 min flight. Temp however was very high in the cabin and my req to lower it a bit were not fulfilled. I started to feel ill and asked for ice to cool my head crew showed no empathy or care. I was glad it was a short flight.,,Economy Class,,,5,2,4,5,,,5,yes,

The service from the staff was great. Very personalized friendly and they spoke fluent English. There was not IFE on A321 but 2 movies were on drop down screens. Excellent IFE on B767 with HD screens and good variety of movies TV series games. Food was very tasty and plenty of alcoholic drinks beverages coffee/tea. They offer newspapers and amenities kits. Great airline to fly with TSE airport small but new and clean.,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,,4,yes,
211,Air Astana customer review,Nicolas Sebastien (Kazakhstan) ,31st December 2014,,I fly regularly on the flight Almaty to Beijing and back. I have to say this is a terrible flight. 4-5 hours at night on an A320. There is little difference between business and economy. The support service for booking and upgrades is simply the worst I have experienced.,,Business Class,,,1,4,3,4,,,1,no,
212,Air Astana customer review,K Miller (United States) ,4th December 2014,,In the last year I have flown Air Astana on 14 different legs now (ALA-SGN ALA-BKK-SGN ALA-ICH and ALA-DEL). During the past the service has been getting better and better. Some irritants during flights such as flight attendants bumping in to your elbows (aisle seats) or waking you up for meals have disappeared. Meals have got better. The old 757 interiors are being renovated. Long flights know offer personal entertainment systems for each person in Economy. All the ticket prices have been reasonable though it is hard to build up miles with Air Astana's Nomad Club. That is one complaint I have with Air Astana. With most airlines I would have gotten free upgrades by now. Many of Air Astana's low fares exclude you from accumulating frequent flier miles. I hope this changes in the future. Overall I say Air Astana is a good carrier to choose nowadays.,,Economy Class,,,4,4,5,4,,,4,yes,
213,Air Astana customer review,Tibbert James (United Kingdom) ,12th November 2014,,I took six flights over two weeks London-Astana Astana-Almaty and Almaty to Tashkent and all of them were very good and I was impressed with the staff quality of food and video/TV system. The flight between Astana and London both ways wasn't very busy and the planes were very modern and well maintained. It was a pleasure and relaxing to fly with them.,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,5,,,5,yes,
214,Air Astana customer review,S J Han (Singapore) ,28th October 2014,,Bangkok-Almaty on 5 Oct 2014 KC932 and return Almaty-Bangkok on 12 Oct 2014 KC931. Check-in staff were friendly and speak good English. The B757 used was clean and have a new look about it. The IFE was reasonably good with offerings of some of the latest films. The cabin crew was friendly helpful and attentive. The overnight flight from Almaty to Bangkok took off at around 1 am. About two hours into the flight a full meal was served. Before landing in Bangkok at around 8.45 a.m. no breakfast was served. For a flight like this suggest that two light meals be served – one shortly after take-off and breakfast before landing. Overall it was a pleasant experience flying with Air Astana.,,Economy Class,,,5,5,4,5,,,4,yes,
215,Air Astana customer review,J Wilson (United Kingdom) ,12th October 2014,,Heathrow to Almaty return via Astana in Business Class. This was the first time that we had flown Air Astana and we were generally pretty impressed. Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapés and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus! Overall we enjoyed our experience with Air Astana perhaps more so than we were expecting and given that they are often keenly priced I would recommend them.,,Business Class,,,4,5,3,3,,,5,yes,
216,Air Astana customer review,Alan Sargeant (Australia) ,8th October 2014,,Moscow - Astana - Almaty - Bangkok. Two of the three sectors were very late at night or early morning and I chose sleep rather than food. It seemed a little strange serving dinner at about 2.00am! It would be better to offer breakfast when flights depart after 11.30 at night. Cabin crew were good and friendly (all seemed to speak good English) and I was allowed to take some items from the dinner menu prior to landing in Bangkok. The Astana - Almaty meal was good and the quantities perfectly adequate. Check in for all flights was quick and easy. I was disappointed that there is no business lounge in Astana for domestic passengers and the lounge in Almaty is one of the worst I have been in for International Business Class. Luggage was relatively quick off the plane especially in Bangkok. The seating was reasonably comfortable and there was adequate leg room on the flights from Moscow to Almaty. From Almaty to Bangkok it is an angled bed which is reasonably comfortable. IFE is very limited but not so important when you only want to sleep on the flight. I had my own entertainment for the Astana Almaty sector. I continue to fly Air Astana because I think that they are probably the best airline in Eurasia and not bad at keeping to their schedules. The flight from Moscow was delayed for about an hour because of a technical problem. We were promptly advised by the crew of nature of the problem and the likely time needed to fix it.,,Business Class,,,4,5,4,2,,,4,yes,
217,Air Astana customer review,Bourne Denzil (United Kingdom) ,30th September 2014,,Three flights around Central Asia this last week. FRU-ALA ALA-TSE and TSE-AUH. The FRU-ALA flight was so short they offer a cabin drinks service on the ground. ALA-TSE we were offered a drink and small snack on the B757 overhead screens played a silent sketch show. TSE-AUH was on an A320. A full cabin service was offered. Entertainment was on overhead screen and amenity packs were provided. One movies and a couple TV shows. Leg room was good on all sectors. Staff all spoke English. But check-in always seemed to be chaotic.,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,2,,,5,yes,
218,Air Astana customer review,A Sargeant (Australia) ,14th September 2014,,Bangkok - Almaty - Astana - Novosibirsk. Good quick check and priority lane in busy Bangkok airport luggage slow off in Almaty (did not get priority despite the label). Good crew and food and wine. The 757 from Bangkok to Almaty was a little tired and angled seats should exclude an airline from four star status. The service from Almaty to Astana was good - a full meal served. From Astana to Novosibirsk there were problems in security checks and no fast lane for business class passengers. Staff helped people with tight connections. The domestic Business lounge in Almaty is very poor but the new lounge in Astana was good. I don't think that they deserve their four star rating but they are improving and the English of the Cabin attendants is a lot better than when I first flew with them 10 years ago. I will continue to choose to fly with them in Central Asia.,,Business Class,,,4,4,5,3,,,3,yes,
219,Air Astana customer review,Ken Robertson (Bulgaria) ,16th June 2014,,7 Feb from ALA To IST. I travel internationally and domestically frequently. Based on my experience Air Astana is a cut above the rest. As a person who is afraid of flying it is a pleasure to see the rapid modernization of the fleet. I am 193cm tall and leg room is important for me Air Astana usually offers the most. The inflight entertainment is current and changes frequently. Lastly I have found the cabin crew to be very supportive. there was one occasion where I complained about the temperature of the cabin being too hot and the senior flight attendant had a customer complaint book where she recorded my complaint. A great initiative which I have never experienced on other airlines.,,Economy Class,,,3,5,4,4,,,4,yes,
224,Air Astana customer review,Karly Lawford (Kazakhstan) ,16th June 2014,,All in all its OK for a relatively short journey and the food's nice. But you should know this: I travel a number of times a year TSE-FRA and am finding more frequent delays with no information given. The last 3 times there were 40 minute-2 hour delays so beware! Quite a lot of confusion at FRA last time when the plane was 90% filled with a single group of Chinese travelling to Urumqi. Don't take a window seat in winter - the a/c isn't up to it and there's an arctic draft every time. Inflight entertainment not much only overhead screens and reruns of candid camera type stuff and one movie repeated on 6 hour flight. Internally in KZ the prices are ridiculously high because they are the only airline which is up to international standards.,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,3,,,4,yes,
225,Air Astana customer review,Kussidi Yuliya (Kazakhstan) ,10th June 2014,,Ala-Astana KC 683 back Astana Almaty KC 954 Almaty-Atyrau (Guriev) - KC 889B Atyrau (Guriev) - Almaty KC 890-B. Good service. Perfect take off and landings. Air Astana continues to work on their services and airfleet and I continue to see an ongoing positive development of the company. Some destinations are more expensive than others but generally good value for money.,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,,4,yes,
226,Air Astana customer review,Murat Sucar (Kazakhstan) ,2nd June 2014,,I fly Air Astana very often almost every week nowadays. I find the experience with new 767 ER relaxing though the flights between Astana and Almaty are always full. The ground staff keep improving. Seems new planes brought a fresh spirit on board. 767 Business Class is great and gives privacy to the customers. Looking forward to flying the Dreamliner. Food is much better than before.,,Business Class,,,5,5,5,4,,,4,yes,
227,Air Astana customer review,Sarimsakci Gokhan Yusuf (Turkey) ,29th May 2014,,KC 951 21 May. KC 856 21 May. I fly Air Astana very often. I find the experience relaxing though the flights between Istanbul and Almaty are usually full. The leg room is good. I think the mileage program could be improved where you could upgrade using your miles during check-in. The food is usually fresh though could be improved. Inflight entertainment is weak and needs improvement. Overall good value for money.,,Economy Class,,,4,4,4,3,,,4,yes,

Had the pleasure of flying Air Astanas new 767 service between Astana and Almaty. It was the best domestic economy class service I have flown. Each seat has in seat videos with the latest films tv music etc. I had a choice of international newspapers as well as a warm sandwich and drink. As usual the crew were smiling multi lingual and well dressed. The seats had a good tilt.,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,,5,yes,
238,Air Astana customer review,Callaghan Colin (Kazakhstan) ,6th April 2014,,I use Air Astana regularly since I have moved to work in Kazakhstan and currently prefer it to the other airlines I have used. I try to arrange my trips back to the UK around the direct flights to LHR. I have never experienced a delayed or cancelled flight the staff are well-trained and generally open and friendly and the food is not exceptional but is of a consistently good quality. I usually travel economy class though on the occasions when I have used business class it has been a good experience.,,Business Class,,,5,5,4,3,,,4,yes,
239,Air Astana customer review,Yergeshbayev Nurbek (Kazakhstan) ,2nd April 2014,,I have been using the services of Air Astana for years. Always a pleasure to travel starting from the convenient way of purchasing the ticket and excellent relation of crew members. I quite often take the domestic flights around two times a month and therefore comfort is crucial for me. In January I travelled to Frankfurt from Astana. As usual right from boarding until landing it was an enjoyable journey.,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,,4,yes,

The seats were comfortable and the leg room was good. I was able to check in online and then at the airport changed my seat to the emergency exit seats due to the extra leg room with no problems at all. Kuala Lumpur is fantastic and as we head towards George Town we are looking forward to exploring more of Malaysia and of course the return flight with Air Astana.,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,4,,,4,yes,

244,Air Astana customer review,Geoffrey Savage (Kazakhstan) ,4th February 2014,,I was lucky enough to be on one of Air Astana's new Boeing 767s returning from Bangkok to Almaty on the 12th January 2014. My business class seat was worth paying the extra over economy with the full lay flat seat and lots of room to spread out with a wide side table. Over the time I've been flying Air Astana I have seen them polishing their cabin service and the professionalism and presentation of the staff is of a high standard. Beverage service was very good although the food let the otherwise excellent travel experience down a little the meal was below par for business class. This was in contrast to the trip down to Bangkok and all previous international flights with Air Astana where the food has been very good.,,Business Class,,,5,4,3,4,,,5,yes,
245,Air Astana customer review,T Pinkstone (United Kingdom) ,30th January 2014,,"Not a bad flight but the use of an ageing 757 with seats that looked like they belonged in the 1970s were a disappointment given the trumpeting of their ""new"" business class on their website - I think this is more than disingenuous but Air Astana are hardly alone in this. Staff were friendly and helpful. Lack of business lounge in ALA a major minus. Food average. All in all fair service as it should be noted that this is half the price of BA.",,Business Class,,,3,3,3,2,,,3,yes,
246,Air Astana customer review,Ilyassov Magzhan (Kazakhstan) ,13th January 2014,,"My family of 2 adults and 2 children flew from Astana to Abu Dhabi (non-stop) and back via Almaty. Although it was a New year vacation period with heavy passenger load all services - starting with tickets sales to luggage delivery were efficient and precise. On our way back we flew a brand new Boeing-767 and it was the best plane I have taken so far. We had to stay in Almaty for a night because of the weather conditions and ""Air Astana"" provided us with great rooms in a downtown hotel and round trip transfer. Staff were polite professional and competitive.",,Business Class,,,5,5,5,4,,,5,yes,
247,Air Astana customer review,Dmitry Kuzin (Russian Federation) ,13th January 2014,,PEK-ALA-TSE-SVO. Red-eye flight from Beijing to Almaty on B757-200. The aircraft is old but well-attended. Seats are ok. Cabin crew speak good English. Catering was served in the middle of the flight. Passengers who were sleeping were not offered their meals and amenity kits. Arrived early. Almaty-Astana-Moscow on A320. Food is tasty. Good choice of drinks including alcohol. Entertainment is outdated - just magazines music and a movie. Both flights on time. Smooth landings. We checked our baggage straight from Beijing to Moscow. It was a bit risky with 2 stop-overs but the airline staff assisted us in Kazakhstan and checked if the bags followed us. They were very helpful and the ground crew were efficient because our baggage arrived safely at SVO. I would recommend Air Astana if the prices are adequate.,,Economy Class,,,4,4,5,4,,,4,yes,

Almaty to Bishkek flight cancelled at last minute - no idea why (heard several explanations ranging from technical issues to lack of passengers). No notification from Astana staff until three hours later. I didn't have visa for Kazakhstan so forced to stay in airport transit lounge overnight. Next day tried to get visa at airport so I could drive to Bishkek. Air Astana people completely unhelpful - said it was impossible. Said I could either stay in airport another night until the next flight or fly to Bishkek via Moscow. Persisted and argued. Finally managed to talk to consulate at airport and received visa and took car to Bishkek. Air Astana refused to refund ticket or pay for visa.,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,N/A,,,1,no,

The basic route for this airline are notoriously delayed. So if you plan on a business trip on this route make sure to factor in at least a fee hours. Better a day. Disappointing. Ground staff not trained on how to deal with this. As a result they are nervous not pleasant and generally not helpful at all.,,Economy Class,,,4,3,2,N/A,,,2,no,

There are a lot of modern new air planes that are being added continuously to Air Astana. The service is much more pleasant and more active inside the plane because the crew are very young comparing to KLM British Airways Lufthansa. The food is comparatively much better than other international airlines. In some planes they have some seats that are very unusual but comfortable you can sleep on them very easy and comfortable. On the international flight prices they are very reasonable. I'm definitely recommending use Air Astana.,,Business Class,,,4,5,5,4,,,5,yes,

We were very pleasantly surprised by the high standard of service and attention given by the cabin crew on all sectors. The aircraft was reassuringly up to date and instead of built in entertainment system had iPad movies/TV at least in Business Class which anyway give a much better picture (and the choice of music is excellent too!). Quality of onboard food out of Almaty was a bit iffy however understood when one takes into account one is in Central Asia. This airline is a little gem and excellent value for money.,,Business Class,,,5,5,3,5,,,5,yes,
261,Air Astana customer review,Sargeant Alan (Australia) ,1st September 2013,,Bangkok - Astana Astana - Almaty Almaty - Istanbul. I have been flying Air Astana regularly for nearly 10 years. I think that they are the best airline in the Russian speaking world. My flights left and landed almost on time although we sat in the plane for an extended period of time in Ho Chi Min city and were not allowed off it. The food was good included the shortish flights between Almaty and Astana. The entertainment on the two long haul sectors was a bit limited. Cabin crew spoke quite good English - even on the internal sectors. Seats and legroom quite comfortable though the seats do not go horizontal on the long sectors.

Sensible costs good service on board friendly crew and tasty meal. The traveler mini-bag was given consisted of toothbrush toothpaste a bandage for sleeping and a pair of socks. On-board entertainment was rather good also pillows for more comfort were provided by default. These airlines will be my choice for future trips to KZ.,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,4,,,5,yes,
267,Air Astana customer review,S Yuen (Hong Kong) ,13th August 2013,,Round trip HKG-ALA-SVO. Meals tasted good. Staff Service excellent both inside and outside the flight. Staff in transfer lounge nice and helpful. Before my return trip from SVO-HKG I had a flight from Riga to SVO with Aeroflot. When I arrived at ALA for transfer the staff of Air Astana suspected and asked if I had any checked luggage. I said I had and Aeroflot had already transferred it to Air Astana as they told me so. He said my luggage was not with the flight according to their record. He also went out to see if my luggage was at claim lounge. He couldn't find mine so took me to report lost baggage. 15 mins after reporting the loss I was waiting for my next flight in departure lounge. My luggage was found at SVO airport. Staff in transfer lounge were professional and helpful.,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,4,,,5,yes,
268,Air Astana customer review,J Martynov (Australia) ,29th July 2013,,Atyrau-Almaty-Bangkok. Atyrau-Almaty flight cancelled without explanation on the day making us stay in Atyrau for additional 2 days without offering accommodation. Replacement flight delayed twice. After we an hour in a check-in queue we were told that they ran out of seats on the plane leaving us and about 20 other passengers stranded. Offered tickets on additional flight on the same day but it was late to get on the connecting flight in Almaty. After 4 hours told that the additional flight was delayed. At 11pm it was announced that the flight was cancelled so we attempted to rebook. Told the next available flight was in 2 days which was unacceptable and we bought tickets with another airline. The next day we flew to Almaty with another airline and got on our connecting flight to Bangkok. As a result of the issues with Air Astana flights we had to spend extra money on the flights in Kazakhstan and Thailand.,,Economy Class,,,3,1,4,1,,,1,no,
269,Air Astana customer review,D Thomas (Kazakhstan) ,16th June 2013,,Fly Air Astana once a week on average internal KZ and international. Consistent friendly service and generally very punctual. Last flight Almaty to Atyrau business class. Boarding always a mess but once on board great service. Occasionally poor attention to regulations with people on mobile phones while taking off and landing but generally getting better.,,Business Class,,,4,5,5,4,,,4,yes,

271,Air Astana customer review,M Jose (United Kingdom) ,2nd June 2013,,Frankfurt-Astana June 1 2013. Economy class. Full house. A bit of a mess at the gate at Frankfurt due to the airline's boarding policy last rows board first. Most people did not know or did not understand this so they waited for their turn as close to the gate agent as possible and as a consequence there was some pushing. Left with a delay of 10 minutes. Very hard working and helpful crew they spoke good English and were always around offering something. Economy passengers received a comfort kit somehow basic but still a nice touch. Inflight entertainment is pre-historic small flat screens hanging from the roof every few metres showing just one film and a couple of cartoons. Drink service several choices including alcohol. Meal service with two options fish or chicken. Nice cheesecake for dessert. Finally after the trays had been collected crew served vanilla ice cream. Although the flight took almost 6 hours with an arrival time of 6 am no breakfast was served. Coffee or tea would have been appreciated especially given the 2 hour immigration queue at Astana upon landing. Overall a more than acceptable experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this airline.,,Economy Class,,,3,4,4,2,,,4,yes,
272,Air Astana customer review,A Csenki (Kazakhstan) ,29th May 2013,,Astana to Frankfurt and back in May 2013. We flew with a large group of small children. Airport staff were helpful with check-in and we were allowed to board first. Cabin staff were very helpful and friendly and dealt well with our kids (handed out children's packs on the way out for example.) Food was good quality and there were films showing throughout the plane (no individual at-seat screens in economy though). A pleasant experience overall!,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,4,,,4,yes,
273,Air Astana customer review,Nadine Kassas (Kazakhstan) ,1st May 2013,,7 hour flight from Almaty to Bangkok this month and it was very comfortable. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The spacing between the rows of seats was very large the seats reclined quite far back. Even though there were no indivdual tv screens for each seat we were each given ipads preloaded with movies which was a brilliant idea. You didn't have a huge choice of movies but most of the recent blockbuster releases were there along with some international movies. Overall it was a very pleasant flight and I would definitely choose to fly with Air Astana again.,,Business Class,,,4,5,4,4,,,4,yes,
274,Air Astana customer review,K Skakov (Kazakhstan) ,18th April 2013,,I frequently fly with Air Astana mostly within Kazakhstan and sometimes abroad. Air Astana is the best airline in Kazakhstan in terms of comfort and service. Luckily I have not had major delays and those which I had were usually weather related. Flight attendants were friendly and professional good aircraft's better legroom choice of food and entertainment helpful customer service. Overall very good progress in the last 5-7 years and dramatically improved flying experience if compared with its predecessor airlines just around 10 years ago.,,Economy Class,,,4,5,5,4,,,5,yes,
275,Air Astana customer review,D Lindblom (Kazakhstan) ,18th April 2013,,Dushanbe - Almaty in business class. A Western standard experience including attentive and friendly cabin crew and excellent food. On time departure and arrival. This short trip was a relaxing moment in a busy day plus got some work done in the spacious seat. The seat armrest was broken though so hopefully a repair was due just after this flight.,,Business Class,,,4,5,5,N/A,,,4,yes,

281,Air Astana customer review,Charles Clarke (Kazakhstan) ,17th April 2013,,Flew from Almaty to Istanbul and was greeted by friendly helpful staff on both the outward and inward journeys.

283,Air Astana customer review,R Hartley (Kazakhstan) ,28th February 2013,,Almaty to Bangkok return. Everything ran on time (slightly ahead of time actually) and service was up to the usual AA high standards. I was offered a free upgrade to Business Class on the return (overnight) trip which was very much appreciated - I slept solidly throughout the journey and felt surprisingly fresh on arrival.,,Economy Class,,,4,5,4,N/A,,,5,yes,
284,Air Astana customer review,A Mellows (Kazakhstan) ,20th February 2013,,ALA-BKK on 13th February 2013 returning on 17th February 2013. Offered a business class upgrade on boarding. The flat bed seats were brilliant for an overnight flight as was the meal drinks selection and level of customer service. A relaxing journey which went quickly due to the level of comfort and service. On the return journey I was in the economy seat I had originally purchased. I slept almost all the way and with my seat fully reclined I was able to stretch my legs out fully. There was certainly more legroom available than on other airlines I have flown into and out of Almaty and Kazakhstan itself. The meal was a lovely Thai chicken curry. The service was great and the drinks trolley was always in service.,,Economy Class,,,5,5,5,5,,,5,yes,
285,Air Astana customer review,Sandy Yang (China) ,15th February 2013,,PEK-ALA-SVO. Both flights arrived on time. Good food and excellent alcohol selection. Service friendly and efficient.

286,Air Astana customer review,Geoff Savage (Kazakhstan) ,14th February 2013,,Return flight from KL to ALA was in complete contrast to the previous flight down. On time crew very friendly and professional. Food and service was very good. After the debacle of the previous flight the agent in KL met me at the gate to again apologise. He had been very helpful previously. I also received an e-mail from the company's senior operations manager who went to lengths to apologise and explain. I do feel this is more than most airlines would do to follow up. This does give confidence that the airline is focussed on continuous improvement. The entertainment unit also had more movies loaded and this kept me fully occupied and well entertained for the flight. However suffice to say that the experience on the return journey was a good one with very good service and perfectly on time with the plane unloading from an air bridge on arrival making unloading of the 767 much more efficient.,,Business Class,,,3,4,4,4,,,4,yes,
287,Air Astana customer review,Dariusz Zietek (Poland) ,30th January 2013,,Flight Almaty - Bishkek December 9th 2012. Horrible experience! All passengers boarded as scheduled by 10pm. Due to weather conditions we were informed we would have to wait. We were kept on the plane from 9.30pm until 4.30am. No reliable info provided by the staff/pilot. No food provided. At 4.30am we were asked to leave the plane and return to the terminal where we were informed that the flight was cancelled and the next one would be in 2 days. Ground staff rude and incompetent. No-one cared to provide us with snacks and hot beverages.,,Economy Class,,,3,1,1,1,,,1,no,
288,Air Astana customer review,G Savage (Kazakhstan) ,23rd January 2013,,"Long delay in departing Almaty bound for KL. Perfect weather although no real excuse given. On boarding more than 2 hours late and by bus from the terminal to the aircraft which caused more delay we sat on the ground for a further 30 mins while a drunken passenger was off-loaded. At least half the flights I have taken with Air Astana have been delayed by hours not just minutes. On-board I asked the cabin crew to see if the connecting flight would be held or if other arrangements needed to be made. Their reply was that 'we will call ground staff and let you know'. The second time was 'we will talk to the captain' the third time was the same answer. On my fourth request I was then told that we have other passengers who are all going to be late. I was travelling on an Air Astana ticket and there was no concern or accountability shown toward this situation. T Arriving in KL with just 10 minutes to spare for the connection on Malaysia Airlines of course we could not board. 767 used on this route is very old although has had some face-lifts. Seats are narrow for business class seats and they are not lay flat they are ""lay on an angle and keep sliding down"" seats. The entertainment system is an IPAD style of portable unit. This only had a choice of three last release movies and at the end of the day there is nowhere to put it where you might consider ergonomically sensible to watch it. I would recommend that you definitely leave a minimum of 5 hours for your connections because they will most likely be late!",,Economy Class,,,3,3,3,2,,,3,no,
289,Air Astana customer review,Shanaka Gooneratne (Australia) ,13th November 2012,,KC907/8 DEL-ALA-DEL on Y class. The Flex fare reasonably priced. Check in both at DEL and ALA was good. Minimal waiting times and the staff were very professional. Board process was ok. Slightly let down by the fact that we were bussed to aircraft and made to board via steps in the rain. Both flights were on well kept clean A320s. Flights were relatively empty so I had 3 seats to myself. Cabin Crew were pleasant and professional. Food and Drink was tasty well presented appropriate for route and time of day. IFE from drop down screens were a bit of a disappointment and hard to follow. Better off bringing a book. Punctual departure and arrival. Would fly again and recommend to others.,,Economy Class,,,4,4,5,3,,,4,yes,

295,Air Astana customer review,M Knowlden (United Kingdom) ,26th July 2012,,ALA-TSB - Emb 190 Business. Early morning business flight. All on time and aircraft full on this relatively new route. Crew were friendly and breakfast was very nice. Departure formalities from Almaty are confusing and bizarre with no priority for business class at any stage apart from check in. No Air Astana staff to guide you through the complexities rather there are hawkers trying to make some cash who are more of a hindrance. Lounge is horrid not even 2* let alone 4*. No priority boarding for business class. Hand held TV offered but I didn't use it. Would happily fly Air Astana again.,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
296,Air Astana customer review,Andrey Zvonkov (Russian Federation) ,24th June 2012,,Service was good provide travel kits headsets entertainment programs excellent but during boarding I was frustrated by rude attitude of flight attendants one flight attendant gave us instructions about emergency exits we set in front and two other crew came to me and asked me if I was instructed or not about emergency exit because I had small bag in my hands. She raised her voice was very aggressive didn't ask me but said firmly that I must change my seat. Then went away to business class returned with flight attendant-supervisor who said it was ok for me to keep my bag in my hands and was very sorry about this situation. I think the crew need more training (working with passengers and working in a team).,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
297,Air Astana customer review,Alan Sargeant (Australia) ,6th June 2012,,Moscow-Almaty-Bangkok. Both flights departed on time. Flight attendants helpful and friendly with reasonable English. Food was good and sufficient. IFE's a bit restricted and out of date for Business Class. Big problems in Almaty because I could not produce the credit card used for the booking. Took several hours of work and an email from a bank in Australia before I was allowed to board the flight. Flight full from Moscow to Almaty and only a third full from Almaty to Bangkok. Despite the problems with credit cards I will still fly them.,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
298,Air Astana customer review,Michael Adi (Indonesia) ,30th May 2012,,KUL-ALA-AKX return. First flight from KUL-ALA on their 767-300 flight was on time and service was great. But for a 7 hour flight it was quite hot in the cabin. Had some trouble with my visa-on-arrival in Almaty but the ground crew were very helpful translating throughout the immigration process: they even carried my bags and checked them in for my connecting flight while I was waiting for my visa. Flights from ALA-AKX and return were good got on their new Embraer and the service onboard was excellent though the crew does need improvements their English. Overall it was a great experience and would like to fly them again.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
299,Air Astana customer review,Alan Sargeant (Australia) ,7th May 2012,,Bangkok to Almaty. Excellent flight friendly and helpful flight attendants. Cabin crews English is getting better and more than adequate for a foreigner travelling with them. Food was good but could have been a little better. Seats good - not quite a bed but allow you to stretch and sleep. Portable hand held entertainment units not so good compared with other airlines. I upgraded at airport and this represents excellent value. Pre-booked business class is not good value.,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
300,Air Astana customer review,Y Badikova (Kazakhstan) ,24th April 2012,,ALA-AYT-ALA. Very polite and professional staff onboard. Excellent serving of special meals as ordered at booking and excellent care for children and aged passengers. I would recommend providing more toiletries (hand lotion combs etc).

All 4 were on time excellent service by cabin crew very good food and drink selection - both on domestic and international legs.

308,Air Astana customer review,P Butterworth (United Kingdom) ,12th December 2011,,Amsterdam to Atyrau return. Using Air Astana many times (not just this route) I have found the flights to be very expensive and often delayed due to technical issues or weather plus chaotic check-in staff! However the flight itself is well above average in food flight entertainment and service. Taking into account the experience from arriving at the airports plus the cost of the flight one would expect a smooth journey per se. Unfortunately this is not the case! Being a state airline and promoted as such there is a lot of room for improvement in this area.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes,
309,Air Astana customer review,D Olsson (Australia) ,2nd October 2011,,Almaty-Astana return and Almaty-Abu Dhabi and all flights were fine. Check-in cabin service average food basic no delays. The Abu Dhabi flight was in an A320 though so entertainment and facilities were limited. It's like a lesser western airline but they do seem well-organised and have a good website. The only problem I had was caused by Etihad. I booked a codeshare through the Etihad website as it was the same price but included a bus to Dubai. However the bus departure time on my ticket did not exist and had never existed. I had to wait 3 hrs for a bus. If they had provided accurate information I would have made alternate arrangements.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
310,Air Astana customer review,B Lohse (Kazakhstan) ,10th September 2011,,Almaty to London. The service was pleasant and efficient KCTV was handed out as soon as seat belt signs went out so the time waiting for drinks to be served passed quickly by.

The food is ok there was IFE via a small flip-down video screen and headsets were handed out to all passengers in time. During the flight from TSE to SVO they issued a travel pack (flight socks blindfold comb). I did have a complaint with the customer service from one member of the cabin crew and requested a comment form which was handled professionally by other members of the crew.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes,

There was plenty of space but would prefer truly flat beds. Friendly check-in in Bangkok and food was better than expected. Allowed to stay in the Business lounge while I waited for the connecting flight to Astana. Business lounge in Bangkok was very ordinary and toilets were in a different area. Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. Everything was adequate and better food than I expected. These flights were still full.,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,

Entire day wasted in Astana airport eventually placed on a late afternoon totally packed flight. Guaranteed exit row instead given tiny seat with zero leg room. Food absolutely dreadful.

Seats in business are rather tired but still comfortable and service is very good; Air Astana FA's are always professional and friendly. Good food both in economy and business. Flights operated on time. Overall this again was a good experience and I would recommend using KC rather than other domestic carriers (which are to be honest very few in Kazakhstan).,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes,

Had seats 29A+B for myself (exit row seats) on both flights with huge legroom. Special meal delivered as requested. ALA-PEK-ALA are the night flights so service was unobtrusive if you like which is good for couple of hours sleep.

Flight to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty not too bad or unpleasant considering I was en route already for 25 days (spending 18 hours in horrible Dubai Airport). My suitcase was damaged by rough handling. The flight Ust-Kamenogorsk to Astana was not bad either. Astana-Dubai flight started with a hiccup - since the customs people did not know where Namibia is and I was looked at very suspiciously despite having a private Visa and being with my Kazakhstan wife. The flight was very unpleasant - seats the most uncomfortable for such a flight! Attendants not interested in making the flight a wee-bit more comfortable. Prices not too bad - however flying to the destinations I need to go to there is no alternative to compare. Being the national airline there is much room for improvement.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no,

Ppolite staff food very reasonable a good selection of drinks and in-flight entertainment. On occasion the flights can be late but this is more due to the weather and the odd mechanical hiccup however this has improved. You may find this airline very expensive (Amsterdam to Atyrau) with 50% saving to be had via other routings. These comments relate to trips Amsterdam to Atyrau Atyrau to Aktau and Istanbul to Atyrau over the last 3 years.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes,

Although we checked in on the website they couldn't provide the same seats so we had to sit separately from my wife. They also sold 1 ticket for 2 people but they just couldn't do anything with the situation. The only way would've been to seat one of these guys to the business class. We waited 2 hours on the plane (of course some people missed their connection in Bangkok in the result of this unprofessionalism) until they saw no other solution but that. Very unprofessional attitude. Later on cabin crew were helpful and friendly food was OK good classical music channel to listen airplane relatively new clean very small legroom though for a tall guy.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,

They have launched a web check-in service but do not have a terminal to print the boarding pass at the airport. I find it rather uncomfortable due to the fact that you can't often find a printer when traveling on business trips. On my last trip I've checked-in online printed my boarding pass but I have learned that my seat doesn't exist because they've changed the plane. I've found it out only when I was onboard. Maybe not so terrible but not too good.,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1,no,

We were late out of Almaty but that was not a real problem as the service on the plane was professional. The seat pitch is okay for the 4 hour or so flight to Dubai as is the food. Entertainment was via overhead video units but it was fine to view. No problems with disembarking in Dubai. Equally the return flight was good leaving Dubai at 2300 - good food and service on board.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
337,Air Astana customer review,R Oussalah (Kazakhstan) ,7th September 2009,,"GUW-AMS B767-300 Business class. I have to say the service has greatly improved. The seating is classic but very spacious. The plane is aging but clean. The onboard service is fair to good and IFE surprisingly diverse. I checked no for ""value"" for money because this ticket costs double the price of a twice as long flight on CX or AF.",,Business Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes,
338,Air Astana customer review,R Oussalah (Thailand) ,23rd August 2009,,Have flown several times on Almaty - Bangkok route. Whilst not at the level of top airlines I had no problems at all. Flights on time. Food OK. Planes relatively new and clean. Happy to continue as is quickest route for me and no complaints.,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
339,Air Astana customer review,R Oussalah (Kazakhstan) ,26th July 2009,,GUW-IST-GUW A320. Check in smooth and the flight was on time. The plane was a new A320. IFE was limited but this was a 3.5 hour flight. The onboard service was adequate for a medium haul economy class flight. No complaints except for the incredible rise of prices on Air Astana International flights. From Kazakhstan we do not have much choice of airlines and Air Astana is still the only one with a descent safety record so I prefer to use it despite the ever increasing prices.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,yes,
340,Air Astana customer review,S Bryant (United Kingdom) ,7th July 2009,,"The comments about this airline mostly relate to their international flights and I understand that they offer a good service there. It's a different story on their internal and regional flights. I booked on-line for the short hop return from Bishkek to Almaty. It seemed like a good idea at the time but proved to be a disaster. The airline changed their schedule without informing me their records apparently said that they had ""tried to contact me"" - I'm not even sure how. I turned up at the airport and waited for 5 hours assuming that it had simply been delayed for that time only to find out that they had moved me not to that flight but to one 20 hours earlier. The Air Astana agent acted as though he hadn't seen an e-ticket before claimed I hadn't paid for the outward journey or maybe hadn't paid at all - really any excuse to not allow me onto the plane. I had no alternative but to go back to Bishkek and travel overland the next day - all at my own expense of course. The return flight had been similarly moved but a local agent helped me out to properly arrange that one and got a refund for the outward journey. I complained to Air Astana as my non-arrival had seriously thrown out the plans of my hosts in Almaty not just mine. No answer. I complained again only to receive a fob off reply that they regretted this but they weren't going to do anything further about it and hoped that I would fly with them again: I doubt that very much. I've given 1 rather than 0 as the Almaty to Bishkek ""return"" flight itself wasn't bad. Their ground service and support in these regional centres very much needs to upgraded to the same standard as their flight experience.",,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,1,no,
341,Air Astana customer review,I Williamson (Saudi Arabia) ,21st June 2009,,Air Astana is right up there with other non-mainstream airlines who do more to please than most. Great service great food an interior decor and outside livery that have a quality design. Air Astana customers include many oil industry personnel who have flown often worldwide and positive comments are often noticeable among passengers. Agree with a previous comment about FAs who are very pleasant. Service to Atyrau has improved leaps and bounds from the days when a worker cigarette in mouth and large hosepipe in hand used to bang the hull of the plane to talk to the pilot about refuelling. The airport is still a bus station though.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
342,Air Astana customer review,J Williams (United Kingdom) ,4th June 2009,,Almaty - Atyrau - Amsterdam in Business. Seats are comfortable although not lay flat and space is more than enough. Their duvets are perfect. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful. Food is good service is second to none. Aircraft was clean and flights operated on time. On the ground staff are very helpful. However the Business class lounge is severely lacking in facilities in Almaty. Not even free drinks. In Atyrau there are no Business class facilities at all! Terminal facilities generally in Atyrau are severely lacking. Its not possible to get any refreshments in any way shape or form once you are in the departure lounge. Thankfully if you are just transiting through Atyrau to Almaty or vice versa you're not in there long. All in all very pleased with service its just a shame that terminal facilities let down the rest of the service. Sort that out and its 10/10! Keep up the good work.,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
343,Air Astana customer review,S Ivanov (Kazakhstan) ,29th March 2009,,The have good cabin crew quality of food is good. Their fleet is new enough and I know from some sources that they do their best to provide safety and best service. Sometimes it seems that the prices are too high but if you order tickets via internet you will get a discount especially on trips with some promotions. But this service is worth to be paid.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
344,Air Astana customer review,M Markus (Switzerland) ,26th March 2009,,Moscow-Astana-Almaty return. First sectors a 3.5h night flight and wasn't really crowded. I had a row for myself so laid down and had a sleep. Unfortunately after 1h they switched on the lights and served some food. I tried to continue my sleep. As we were delayed and as I didn't have an absolute proper Visa it took me a while for immigration. Searching my bag was easy even I was late and the belts already stopped. Air Astana had some helpful staff there and got my Bag from the luggage room in a minute. Finally I didn't catch my connecting flight. But the rebooking to the next Astana-Almaty flight worked without problems on this Airport. On this flight they served breakfast that was OK. ALA Airport is hell. Staff (even Air Astana check- in) is nearly not speaking English and to get to the domestic check-in you have to have a print out of your ticket as they don't know what an e-ticket is. Staff in-flight was always kind and helpful and had a good English.,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,4,yes,
